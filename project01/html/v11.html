      <p>Snow Piece (from Grapefruit)</p>
      <br>
      <p>Think that snow is falling.</p>
      <p>Think that snow is falling everywhere all the time.</p>
      <p>When you talk with a person, think that snow is falling between you and on the person.</p>
      <p>Stop conversing when you think the person is covered by snow.</p>
